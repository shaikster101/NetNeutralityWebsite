Net neutrality heavily benefits low income communities since they donâ€™t have to pay much to gain access to the Internet. They will be getting the same speeds and connections as everyone else in society, thus reducing the effects of the wage disparity.


Although the end of net neutrality may be tough on low income communities on gaining access to the Internet, they will still be able to gain access to popular sites with fast speeds. Getting rid of net neutrality means getting rid of useless stored data which will lead to fast connections to prioritized content.
