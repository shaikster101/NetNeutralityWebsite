Net neutrality affects the society as a whole, since it is filled with Internet users from different areas of the world. In the United States alone, there are about 275 million Internet users. Different people have different interests in what sites they like to browse, what content they want to stream, etc. Without net neutrality, some people may get benefited, since their favorite sites may be the ones prioritized for faster connections, while others have to deal with slow connections.



However, There is a lot of content on the Internet that is heavily unused. This tends to slow down Internet connections since data is being stored without a purpose. In addition, there is a lot of questionable and offensive content on the Web that may thrive due to net neutrality. Getting rid of net neutrality may allow ISPs to block access to this type of content, which will primarily benefit in restricting children and families from viewing.
