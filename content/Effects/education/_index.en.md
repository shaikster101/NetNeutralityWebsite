Students around the country have different levels of educational benefits since it is primarily dependent on what their schools can afford. Some schools may not be able to afford paying ISPs extra money to give their students access to more content. Having net neutrality will allow everybody to equally access everything around the Web. A plethora of educational content for students to browse will be extremely beneficial in terms of learning, research, study methods, etc. 


On the other hand, the riddance of net neutrality can heavily benefit schools with an enormous amount of funding. Paying for premium speeds will allow students to view educational content with fast speeds, making the learning process more feasible. In addition, schools can have the ISPs block access to content that is not related to education. This can have students concentrate better and mitigate any distractions that may come about.
