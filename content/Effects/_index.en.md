## A Closer look


### Effect on Education: 

#### Pros: 
Students around the country have different levels of educational benefits since it is primarily dependent on what their schools can afford. Some schools may not be able to afford paying ISPs extra money to give their students access to more content. Having net neutrality will allow everybody to equally access everything around the Web. A plethora of educational content for students to browse will be extremely beneficial in terms of learning, research, study methods, etc.

#### Cons: 
On the other hand, the riddance of net neutrality can heavily benefit schools with an enormous amount of funding. Paying for premium speeds will allow students to view educational content with fast speeds, making the learning process more feasible. In addition, schools can have the ISPs block access to content that is not related to education. This can have students concentrate better and mitigate any distractions that may come about.

### Effects on Healthcare

#### Pros: 
Modern healthcare heavily relies on technology and telecommunication. Net neutrality benefits the healthcare industry by allowing patients to gain access to information and services with low and reliable costs. Healthcare providers are also able to deliver information through telecommunication services with low costs as well. In addition, healthcare is transitioning to integrating fitness trackers, mobile apps, and other devices that require connection to the Internet so it is important that everybody is able to connect to these devices in the same manner.

#### Cons: 
Because there is a lot of unused content on the Web eating up data and storage space, connections may tend to slow down. Fast connections are integral in the healthcare industry since services that use the Internet such as Telehealth require immediate care. Slow connections will heavily negatively impact critical care for patients

### Effects on Low Income Communities: 

#### Pros: 
Net neutrality heavily benefits low income communities since they don’t have to pay much to gain access to the Internet. They will be getting the same speeds and connections as everyone else in society, thus reducing the effects of the wage disparity.

#### Cons: 
Although the end of net neutrality may be tough on low income communities on gaining access to the Internet, they will still be able to gain access to popular sites with fast speeds. Getting rid of net neutrality means getting rid of useless stored data which will lead to fast connections to prioritized content.

### Effects on Society: 

#### Pros: 
Net neutrality affects the society as a whole, since it is filled with Internet users from different areas of the world. In the United States alone, there are about 275 million Internet users. Different people have different interests in what sites they like to browse, what content they want to stream, etc. Without net neutrality, some people may get benefited, since their favorite sites may be the ones prioritized for faster connections, while others have to deal with slow connections.

#### Cons: 
However, There is a lot of content on the Internet that is heavily unused. This tends to slow down Internet connections since data is being stored without a purpose. In addition, there is a lot of questionable and offensive content on the Web that may thrive due to net neutrality. Getting rid of net neutrality may allow ISPs to block access to this type of content, which will primarily benefit in restricting children and families from viewing.
