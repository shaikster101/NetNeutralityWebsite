### What is It?

Net neutrality is the notion that all data on the Internet should be treated equally by Internet service providers. Internet service providers (ISPs), such as Comcast or Verizon,  are companies that provide access to the Internet with a subscription. Net neutrality requires all ISPs in the world to provide the same level of Internet speed for all users and for all content found on the Web. Certain data shouldn’t be inserted into “fast lanes” while making certain other material harder to access.

### What does it Do? 

Without net neutrality, only prioritized websites will be able to get accessed with high level speeds. All of the other websites will be accessed with a slower speed, unless consumers pay the ISPs additional fees for faster connections to their favorite sites. Net neutrality will allow every website to be accessed with the same speed to avoid discrimination.
