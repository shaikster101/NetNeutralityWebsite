Net neutrality is the notion that all data on the Internet should be treated equally by Internet service providers. Internet service providers (ISPs), such as Comcast or Verizon,  are companies that provide access to the Internet with a subscription. Net neutrality requires all ISPs in the world to provide the same level of Internet speed for all users and for all content found on the Web. Certain data shouldn’t be inserted into “fast lanes” while making certain other material harder to access.
