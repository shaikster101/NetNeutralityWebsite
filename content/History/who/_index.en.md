Net neutrality was coined by Columbia University law professor Tim Wu in 2003. During this time, common carriers were pretty popular. These were companies that provided public telecommunications facilities. Similar to net neutrality, there were common carrier regulations that required all connections to telecommunications facilities be treated the same. The notion of net neutrality regarding the Internet branched out from this and is still a heated debate to this day.
