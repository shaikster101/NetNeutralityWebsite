#### Who defined Net Neutrality? 

Net neutrality was coined by Columbia University law professor Tim Wu in 2003. During this time, common carriers were pretty popular. These were companies that provided public telecommunications facilities. Similar to net neutrality, there were common carrier regulations that required all connections to telecommunications facilities be treated the same. The notion of net neutrality regarding the Internet branched out from this and is still a heated debate to this day.

#### What sparked a national conversation about Net Neutrality? 

Back in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the North Carolina service provider Madison River for blocking phone calls over the Internet. Later in 2008, the FCC ordered Comcast to stop slowing down connections to BitTorrent. Comcast later sued the FCC and argued that they can slow down connections if they want to. In 2009, AT&T restricted iPhone users from making Skype calls, having Apple get in trouble with the FCC. All of these events sparked the notion of net neutrality.

#### When was it passed into law? 

Due to many ongoing events about various ISPs restricting speeds to certain aspects of the Internet, the FCC passed the first net neutrality order in 2015. This order was called the Open Internet Order and it was a set of regulations that first defined net neutrality and required ISPs to provide connections to all content with the same speed.

#### Why was it repealed? 

Ajit Pai, who is the FCCâ€™s chairman, was always opposed to net neutrality. He believed that net neutrality should not be imposed because he was a proponent of a free and open Internet. He also believes that ISPs will be able to gain a gargantuan amount of profit by charging an additional fee for consumers to obtain faster speeds. He voted against the Open Internet Order in 2017 and in June of 2018, the FCC repealed net neutrality, ending all of its regulations in the United States.
