Ajit Pai, who is the FCCâ€™s chairman, was always opposed to net neutrality. He believed that net neutrality should not be imposed because he was a proponent of a free and open Internet. He also believes that ISPs will be able to gain a gargantuan amount of profit by charging an additional fee for consumers to obtain faster speeds. He voted against the Open Internet Order in 2017 and in June of 2018, the FCC repealed net neutrality, ending all of its regulations in the United States.
