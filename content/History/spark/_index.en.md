Back in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the North Carolina service provider Madison River for blocking phone calls over the Internet. Later in 2008, the FCC ordered Comcast to stop slowing down connections to BitTorrent. Comcast later sued the FCC and argued that they can slow down connections if they want to. In 2009, AT&T restricted iPhone users from making Skype calls, having Apple get in trouble with the FCC. All of these events sparked the notion of net neutrality.
